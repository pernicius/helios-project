Next steps in Vulkan:
 - [x] **Renderer Core**
   - [x] `VKInstance`: Manages the connection to the Vulkan API.
     - [x] Gathers required extensions from GLFW.
     - [x] Sets up validation layers for debugging.
     - [x] Better filtering of the validation layers callback messages.
     - [x] Use builder style creation pattern
   - [x] `VKDebugMessenger`: Captures validation layer messages.
   - [x] `VKSurface`: Creates the window surface (`VkSurfaceKHR`) to render to.
     - Requires `VKInstance` and the `GLFWwindow`.
 - [x] **Device Abstraction**
   - [x] `DeviceManager`: Manages the physical and logical devices.
     - Requires `VKInstance` and `VKSurface`.
     - [x] Selects a suitable `VkPhysicalDevice`.
     - [x] Creates the `VkLogicalDevice` and retrieves `VkQueue` handles.
 - [x] **Presentation**
   - [x] `VKSwapchain`: Manages the list of images to be presented to the screen.
     - Requires `DeviceManager` and `VKSurface`.
     - [x] Creates `VkImageViews` for each swapchain image.
 - [ ] **Graphics Pipeline**
   - [x] `VKRenderPass`: Defines the structure of a rendering operation (attachments, subpasses).
     - [ ] Use builder style creation pattern
   - [ ] `VKPipeline`: The main graphics pipeline object.
     - [ ] Loads SPIR-V shader code.
     - [ ] Configures vertex input, viewport, rasterizer, etc.
     - [ ] Use builder style creation pattern
     - Requires `DeviceManager` and `VKRenderPass`.
 - [ ] **Frame Buffers**
   - [ ] `VKFramebuffer`: Links a `VKRenderPass` with the specific `VkImageViews` to be rendered into.
     - [ ] Create one framebuffer for each swapchain image view.
 - [ ] **Command Buffers & Synchronization**
   - [ ] `VKCommandPool`: Allocates command buffers integrate into VKDeviceManager.
   - [ ] `VKCommandBuffer`: Records rendering commands.
   - [ ] Create synchronization primitives (`VkSemaphore`, `VkFence`) for each frame in flight.
 - [ ] **Basic Rendering**
   - [ ] Implement the main render loop.
     - [ ] Acquire an image from the swapchain.
     - [ ] Record commands into a command buffer (bind pipeline, set viewport, draw).
     - [ ] Submit the command buffer to a graphics queue.
     - [ ] Present the rendered image to the screen.
   - [ ] Draw the first triangle!
 - [ ] **Advanced Topics (Future)**
   - [ ] Vertex Buffers and Index Buffers.
   - [ ] Uniform Buffers and Descriptor Sets.
   - [ ] Texture Mapping.
   - [ ] Multithreaded command buffer recording.
